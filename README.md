# Stock Search
## Description
Stock Search is a C++ console application that analyzes stock data from the Dow 30 index and yields the top best (or worst) performing days for a selected criteria. It incorporates 5 years of market data, totalling to over 260,000 data points. We incorporated both heap and merge sort algorithms to understand performance disparities across different ways of structuring data sets.
